# Triangle-Identifier
### An attempt at learning how to make applications using JavaScript.
#### By Asma Adan
##### Learning JavaScript at Moringa School prep requires the setting up of an application. 
##### This particular  application tells the user whether their measurements amount to a triangle or not. 
##### The application also the tells the user which type of triangle it is; whether it is a Right Triangle, Equilateral triangle, Isosceles triangle, Scalene Triangle, Acute Triangle, Obtuse Triangle.  
##### You can take a look at it and let me know any changes I should make or any suggestions you maybe having or how I should make my portofolio appealing. Thank you in advance.
