# Triangle-Identifier
### An attempt at learning how to make applications using JavaScript.
#### By Asma Adan
##### Learning JavaScript at Moringa School prep requires the setting up of an application using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
##### This particular  application tells the user whether their measurements amount to a triangle or not.
##### The application also the tells the user which type of triangle it is; whether it is a Right Triangle, Equilateral triangle, Isosceles triangle, Scalene Triangle, Acute Triangle, Obtuse Triangle.  
##### You can take a look at it and let me know any changes I should make or any suggestions you maybe having or how I should make my functions better and make the website more appealing. Thank you in advance.
## BDD
#### Want to test how I did this project?
##### Here are the specs:

*The program should return when a value is below 0 or is 0:

    Input:0

    Output: Not a triangle

*The program should return when a combination of two sides is less or equal to the other side

    Input: (A+B <= C) or (B+C <= A) or (C+A <= B)

    Output: Not a triangle

*The Program should return Equilateral when 3 sides inputed are equal

    Input: 35, 35, 35

    Output: Equilateral Triangle

*The Program should return Isosceles if 2 sides are equal

    Input: 35, 35, 50

    Output: Isosceles Triangle

*The Program should return Scalene if 3 sides are not equal

    Input: 36, 20, 50

    Output: Scalene Triangle
